Poster presented at the Annual Drosophila Conference 2023

Division is one of the most important events in the life of a cell, which ensures that the genetic material and the entire set of cellular components segregate in the correct way between the two daughter cells. To divide, cells have to undergo profound shape changes in a timely manner. 
During my PhD I studied how this is regulated using the neuronal stem cells of the fruit fly larval brain. These cells are unusual in that they divide asymmetrically to produce a large and a small daughter cell with different fates.
This model system is particularly interesting because theis type of cells face additional challenges in carrying out a robust division without mistakes, and by studying them we
can learn new mechanisms that are true for animal cell division in general.
